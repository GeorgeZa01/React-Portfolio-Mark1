Setup and Local Development

To run this portfolio or any of its sub-projects locally, please follow these general steps:

Clone the repository:

git clone [https://github.com/YourUsername/your-portfolio-repo.git](https://github.com/YourUsername/your-portfolio-repo.git)
cd your-portfolio-repo


Install dependencies:
Navigate to the root directory of a specific project (e.g., SwiftCart/) and install dependencies:

npm install
# or
pip install -r requirements.txt


Configure Environment Variables:
Create a .env file in the project's root directory based on the provided .env.example. You will need to fill in variables like database connections, API keys, and secret keys.

Run the application:

npm run dev
# or
python manage.py runserver


The application should now be running on http://localhost:3000 (or the port specified in the config).
